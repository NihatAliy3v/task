    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language for web page creation. It allows the
        creation and structure of sections, paragraphs, and links using HTML elements (the building blocks of a web
        page) such as tags and attributes.

        HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:

        Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text,
        hyperlinks, and media files.
        Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is
        heavily used to embed hyperlinks.
        Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
        It’s also worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic
        functionality, although it is now considered an official web standard. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
        maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates.

        This article will go over the basics of HTML, including how it works, its pros and cons, and how it relates to
        CSS and JavaScript. </p>

    <p>The average website includes several different HTML pages. For instance, a home page, an about page, and a
        contact page would all have separate HTML files.

        HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. A web browser reads the HTML file and renders
        its content so that internet users can view it.

        All HTML pages have a series of HTML elements, consisting of a set of tags and attributes. HTML elements are the
        building blocks of a web page. A tag tells the web browser where an element begins and ends, whereas an
        attribute describes the characteristics of an element. </p>
