    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>
        As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they
        are styled, laid out, etc.
        A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language,
        but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
        Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox,
        Chrome, or Edge, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector, or
        printer.

        Note: A browser is sometimes called a user agent, which basically means a computer program that represents a
        person inside a computer system. Browsers are the main type of user agents we think of when talking about CSS,
        however, they are not the only ones. There are other user agents available, such as those that convert HTML and
        CSS documents into PDFs to be printed.
