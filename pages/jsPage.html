    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages —
        every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at —
        displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. —
        you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web
        technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning
        Area.</p>

    <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia,
        animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve
        with a few lines of JavaScript code.)</p>
